SQL is a language used specially for the retrieval of data from databases. "Even when the analysis is being done on another platform like Python or R, SQL would be needed to extract the data that you need from a companyâ€™s database." [9]

In a database, we usually declare the kind of information we are gonna store. We can use different types of data such as text or numbers. Specific datatypes are shown below:
